# Brand Alignment Update - January 5, 2025

## What Changed

### ✅ Fixed: Brand Colors Now Match Your Logo

**Before (Teal/Green - WRONG):**
- Teal: #4ECDC4
- Forest Green: #44A08D
- Light mint backgrounds

**After (Peachy Orange/Brown - CORRECT):**
- **Peachy Orange:** #FFA85C (primary brand color - from your logo)
- **Darker Orange:** #FF9A47 (gradient accent)
- **Dark Brown:** #4A2417 (text/outlines - from your logo)
- **Cream/Butter:** #FFF8E8 (backgrounds - matches your site)
- **White:** #FFFFFF (for contrast)

## What I Used from Your Brand Kit

### Fonts:
✅ **Fredoka** (your brand font)
- Regular (400)
- Medium (500)
- SemiBold (600)
- Bold (700)

### Favicon:
✅ Added all your favicon files
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon-16x16.png
- apple-touch-icon.png

### Colors Extracted from Logo:
- Orange fruit: #FFA85C

- Green leaves: #8FBE9A (accent - not used heavily since corporate)
- White cream: #FFFFFF
- Cream background: #FFF8E8

## Design Strategy

### Why These Colors Work for B2B:

**Your Retail Site (decoponatx.com):**
- Kawaii, playful, maximalist
- Multiple pastels (pink, mint, yellow)
- Very youthful and craft-focused

**This B2B Landing Page:**
- Uses YOUR BRAND ORANGE (from logo)
- More restrained color palette
- Still warm and inviting, but more professional
- Brown text for authority/trust
- Cream backgrounds for sophistication

### Key Differences:
| Element | Retail | B2B Corporate |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Primary Color | Peachy orange + pastels | Peachy orange (focused) |
| Backgrounds | Light mint/cream | Cream only |
| Accent Colors | Multiple pastels | Orange + brown |
| Font | Quicksand | Fredoka |
| Vibe | "Make it cute!" | "Team experiences that last" |
| Audience | DIY crafters | HR/Team managers |

## What's Available in Your Brand Kit (Not All Used Yet)

### Fonts Available:
- ✅ Fredoka (using this)
- Montserrat (not using - Fredoka is more playful/on-brand)
- CuteNote (too casual for B2B)
- SASlowRiver (specialty font - could use for special headers later)

### Images Available:
- Logo variations (transparent, framed, high-res)
- Characters (Deco, Yuzu - could add to footer for personality)
- Product kits (could add to gallery section)
- Event photos (perfect for gallery once you replace placeholders)
- Background patterns (kawaii - probably too playful for B2B)

### What I Recommend Adding Later:
1. **Logo in header** - Add transparent logo to top left
2. **Character mascot in footer** - Add Deco character for brand personality
3. **Event photos in gallery** - Replace placeholders with real event images
4. **Product kit photos** - Use in "What's Included" section

---

## Files Updated:
- ✅ `index.html` - All colors updated to brand orange/brown
- ✅ Fonts loaded from brand kit
- ✅ Favicon linked properly
- ✅ Text alignment fixed

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Launch):
1. [x] Add logo to header ✅ COMPLETED - Sticky header with transparent logo + CTA
2. [ ] Test all fonts load properly
3. [ ] Verify favicon appears

### After First Event:
1. [ ] Replace gallery placeholders with event photos
2. [ ] Add product kit images to value stack
3. [ ] Consider adding Deco character to footer for warmth

### Optional Enhancements:

## Brand Cohesion Achieved ✅

**Before:** Teal/green colors that didn't match your brand at all
**After:** Peachy orange + brown colors directly from your logo

**Result:**
- Looks professional for B2B
- Clearly part of the Decopon family
- Warm and inviting (not cold corporate)
- Differentiates from retail site while maintaining brand identity
